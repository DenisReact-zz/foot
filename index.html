                                    <p class="summary">An ankle sprain is a common injury and usually occurs when the
                                        ankle
                                        is
                                        twisted, causing injury to the soft tissue of the ankle.</p>
                                    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                                    <p>A ligament is made up of multiple strands of tissue similar to a nylon rope. A
                                        sprain
                                        results in tearing of the ligaments. The tear can be a complete tear of all the
                                        strands
                                        of the ligament or a partial tear. The lateral ligaments (those on the outside
                                        of
                                        the
                                        ankle) are by far the most commonly injured ligaments in a typical inversion
                                        injury
                                        of
                                        the ankle.</p>
                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>Initially, the ankle is swollen, painful, and can become bruised due to ruptured
                                        blood
                                        vessels from the tearing of the soft tissues. Most of the initial swelling is
                                        actually
                                        bleeding into the surrounding tissues which increases over the next 24 hours.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>The diagnosis of an ankle sprain is usually made by physical examination of the
                                        ankle
                                        with x-rays to make sure that none of the bones of the ankle are fractured. If
                                        your
                                        doctor suspects that there is a complete rupture of the ligaments, he or she may
                                        order
                                        stress x-rays, as well. These x-rays are taken while someone twists or
                                        “stresses”
                                        the
                                        ligaments. Also an MRI of the injured ankle will give the surgeon the ability to
                                        evaluate the ankle ligaments as well as the surrounding tendons.</p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Treatment begins by using the PRICE principle: Protection, Rest, Ice,
                                        Compression,
                                        and
                                        Elevation. Crutches can prevent weight bearing on the ankle, and casts are used
                                        in
                                        severe cases. Healing of the ligaments usually takes about 6 weeks, but the
                                        swelling
                                        may
                                        be present for several months. Depending upon the severity of the ligament
                                        damage,
                                        physical therapy, surgery and rehabilitation may be suggested.</p>

                                        It can occur in all age groups. Most cases of osteochondritis dissecans usually
                                        follow a
                                        twisting of the ankle.</p>
                                    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                                    <p>Osteochondritis dissecans occurs at the top of the talus. Most of these lesions
                                        are
                                        thought to be caused by injury to the bone underneath the joint surface by a
                                        twisting
                                        injury. Some are actual chip type fractures, while others may result from injury
                                        to
                                        the
                                        bone’s blood supply causing an area of the bone to actually die.</p>
                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>Osteochondritis dissecans can cause swelling and a generalized ache in the ankle.
                                        There
                                        may also be a “catching” sensation with the ankle in certain positions.</p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>The history and physical examination may suggest the diagnosis of osteochondritis
                                        dissecans. X-rays of the ankle usually reveal a defect on the talar dome. A CAT
                                        scan
                                        or
                                        MRI scan may be necessary to determine the full extent of the area involved.</p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Treatment for osteochondritis dissecans depends on when the problem is
                                        discovered. If
                                        the
                                        problem is discovered immediately after a twisting injury to the ankle, then
                                        immobilization in a cast for 6 weeks may be suggested to see if the bone heals.
                                        If
                                        the
                                        problem is not associated with an acute injury, surgery may be required to try
                                        and

                                    <p class="summary">Because we use our feet continually, tendinitis in the foot is a
                                        common
                                        problem. One of the most frequently affected tendons is the posterior tibial
                                        tendon.

                                    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                                    <p>The posterior tibial tendon runs behind the inside bump on the ankle, across the
                                        instep,
                                        and into the bottom of the foot. The tendon is important in supporting the arch
                                        of
                                        the
                                        foot and helps turn the foot inward during walking. Initially, irritation of the
                                        outer
                                        covering of the tendon causes inflammation around the tendon as it runs through
                                        the
                                        tunnel behind the inside bump of the ankle. As we age, the tendon is subject to
                                        degeneration within the tendon. The normal arrangement of the fibers of the
                                        tendon
                                        becomes jumbled and the tendon loses strength. This condition is called
                                        tendinosis.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>The symptoms of tendinitis of the posterior tibial tendon include pain in the
                                        instep
                                        area
                                        of the foot and swelling along the course of the tendon. In some cases the
                                        tendon
                                        may
                                        actually rupture due the weakening of the tendon by the inflammatory process.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>Rupture of the tendon leads to a fairly pronounced flatfoot deformity that is
                                        easily
                                        recognizable.</p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Treatment of posterior tibial tendinitis begins with a good supportive arch
                                        support,
                                        decreased activity, and anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or
                                        aspirin.
                                        If
                                        the condition has been present for a long time, a brace known as an AFO (Ankle
                                        Foot

                                        ruptured,
                                        surgery may be required to repair or reconstruct the tendon. This is also the
                                        case

                                    <p>The Achilles tendon is a strong, fibrous band that connects the calf muscles to

                                        heel.
                                        When the muscles contract, they pull on the Achilles tendon causing your foot to
                                        point
                                        down and helping you raise up on your toes, sprint, jump, or climb. Several

                                    <p>Tendocalcaneal bursitis begins with pain, irritation, and swelling at the back of

                                        heel. Achilles tendinitis usually occurs farther up the leg, just above the heel
                                        bone
                                        itself. Pain is present with walking or touching the area. Finally, Achilles

                                        rupture is usually an unmistakable event. Sometimes a snap can be heard, and the
                                        victim
                                        of a rupture usually describes a sensation like “someone kicked me in the calf.”
                                        Following rupture there can be swelling in the calf and usually the patient
                                        cannot
                                        rise
                                        up on the toes.</p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>Diagnosis is almost always made based on clinical history and physical
                                        examination.
                                        In
                                        cases where there is an Achilles tendon rupture in question, an MRI scan may be
                                        necessary to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

                                        tendon. The classic example is the middle-aged tennis player or “weekend

                                        who
                                        places too much stress on the tendon and experiences a rupture of the tendon.

                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>Tendocalcaneal bursitis begins with pain, irritation, and swelling at the back of
                                        the
                                        heel. Achilles tendinitis usually occurs farther up the leg, just above the heel
                                        bone
                                        itself. Pain is present with walking or touching the area. Finally, Achilles
                                        tendon
                                        rupture is usually an unmistakable event. Sometimes a snap can be heard, and the
                                        victim
                                        of a rupture usually describes a sensation like “someone kicked me in the calf.”
                                        Following rupture there can be swelling in the calf and usually the patient
                                        cannot
                                        rise
                                        up on the toes.</p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>Diagnosis is almost always made based on clinical history and physical
                                        examination.
                                        In
                                        cases where there is an Achilles tendon rupture in question, an MRI scan may be
                                        necessary to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Medical treatment for tendocalcaneal bursitis and Achilles tendinitis usually
                                        consists of
                                        a combination of rest, anti-inflammatory medication, and physical therapy. Many
                                        orthopedists and podiatric surgeons feel that Achilles tendon ruptures in
                                        younger
                                        active
                                        patients should be repaired surgically due to the increased strength of the
                                        healed
                                        tendon following surgery versus non-operative cast treatment.</p>

                                        There are probably many underlying causes of heel pain and some physicians feel
                                        that
                                        it
                                        is probably more accurate to simply make a diagnosis of “heel pain” rather than
                                        try
                                        and

                                    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                                    <p>The plantar fascia is a structure that runs from the front of the heel bone
                                        (calcaneus)
                                        to the ball of the foot. This dense strip of tissue helps to support the
                                        longitudinal
                                        arch of the foot by acting similar to the string on a bow. When the foot is on
                                        the
                                        ground a tremendous amount of force is concentrated on the plantar fascia,
                                        leading
                                        to
                                        stress where it attaches to the calcaneus. Small tears of the tendon can result,
                                        and
                                        although the body often heals itself, repeated injury and repair causes a bone
                                        spur
                                        to
                                        form in the hopes of firmly attaching the fascia to the bone.</p>
                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>This condition causes pain on the bottom or center of the heel when putting
                                        weight on
                                        the
                                        foot. This is usually most pronounced in the morning when the foot is first
                                        placed
                                        on
                                        the floor. Other patients will complain of pain when standing after a brief rest
                                        of
                                        sitting.</p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>The diagnosis of plantar fasciitis is generally made after the history and
                                        physical
                                        examination. There are several conditions that can cause heel pain and plantar
                                        fasciitis
                                        must be distinguished from these conditions. An x-ray can rule out a stress
                                        fracture
                                        of
                                        the calcaneus and show whether a bone spur is present that is large enough to
                                        actually
                                        cause problems. Laboratory investigation may be necessary in some cases to rule
                                        out
                                        a
                                        systemic illness causing the heel pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter’s
                                        syndrome,
                                        or ankylosing spondylitis.</p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Supporting the area with orthotics such as a well-fitted arch support or
                                        inserting a
                                        heel
                                        cup can reduce the pressure on the sore area and add padding to a heel that has
                                        lost
                                        some of the fat pad through degeneration. Anti-inflammatory medications are
                                        sometimes
                                        used to reduce pain. An injection of cortisone onto the area of the fascia is
                                        effective
                                        but should be used sparingly because this medication may contribute to the
                                        process
                                        of
                                        degeneration of the fat pad or rupture of the plantar fascia, actually making
                                        the
                                        problem worse.</p>
                                    <p>A gentle stretch held for at least one minute several times per day is extremely
                                        helpful.
                                        As a last resort, surgical procedures can be used to remove the bone spur,
                                        release
                                        the
                                        plantar fascia, or release pressure on the small nerves in the area.</p>

                                    <p>The nerves of the foot run into the forefoot and out to the toes between the long
                                        bones
                                        of the feet. Once they reach the end, they split and continue out to the end of
                                        the
                                        toes. Each nerve splits to supply sensation to half of two different toes. A

                                        neuroma occurs just before the nerve splits into the two branches. The cause of

                                        neuroma is not entirely understood but likely results from chronic injury to the

                                        in this area. </p>
                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>The neuroma usually causes pain in the ball of the foot with weight bearing. Many
                                        people
                                        with this condition report feeling a painful “catching” sensation while walking

                                        involved
                                        nerve.</p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>The diagnosis is usually made based on history and physical examination alone.
                                        X-rays
                                        are
                                        only useful to make sure the pain is not coming from some other cause such as a
                                        stress
                                        fracture. </p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Treatment of Morton’s neuroma usually begins with shoe adaptations. Sometimes
                                        simply
                                        moving to a wider shoe will reduce or eliminate the symptoms. New research shows
                                        locally
                                        injecting the nerve over a series of several weeks with a sclerosing agent may
                                        resolve
                                        the symptoms without surgery. However, if this fails to resolve the pain,
                                        surgery
                                        may be
                                        suggested to remove a portion of the nerve.</p>

                                        people in
                                        cultures that wear shoes. In most cases, these problems can be traced to
                                        improperly
                                        fitting shoes.</p>
                                    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                                    <p>The hammertoe deformity usually starts on the larger toes and creates a curved
                                        appearance, often a result of shoes that are too short. If the deformity isn’t
                                        corrected, over time the other toe joints will become hyperextended and also
                                        curl.

                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>Starting out flexible and becoming rigid over time, toes that are squished day
                                        after
                                        day
                                        become fixed in the curled position and will not straighten out. Pressure builds
                                        up
                                        at
                                        the end of the toe and over the joints, causing painful calluses to develop.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>Diagnosis is obvious from the physical exam. In some cases, special tests may be
                                        required
                                        to make sure no other nerve problems are to blame for the condition. </p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Early in the process, simply switching to shoes that fit properly can stop the
                                        process
                                        and return the toes to a more normal condition. If the condition is more
                                        advanced
                                        and
                                        the toes will not completely straighten out on their own, a contracture may
                                        exist.
                                        Pressure points and calluses caused by the contractures can be treated by
                                        switching
                                        to
                                        shoes that have more room in the toes or by placing pads over the calluses to
                                        relieve
                                        the pressure. If all else fails, surgery may be suggested to correct the
                                        alignment
                                        of
                                        the toe. After surgery, you will usually be fitted with a postoperative shoe
                                        with a
                                        stiff, wooden sole that protects the toes by keeping the foot from bending. Pins
                                        placed
                                        in the toes during surgery to help them heal straight are usually removed after

                                    <p>“Hallux” is the medical term for big toe and “valgus” is an anatomic term meaning
                                        the
                                        deformity goes in a direction away from the midline of the body. With a bunion,
                                        the
                                        big
                                        toe begins to point toward the outside of the foot. After time, the bone just
                                        above
                                        the
                                        big toe, the first metatarsal, develops too much of an angle in the other
                                        direction.
                                        The
                                        bunion that develops is a response to the pressure from the shoe on the point of
                                        this
                                        angle. At first the bump is made up of irritated, swollen tissue that is
                                        constantly
                                        caught between the shoe and the bone beneath the skin. After time, the constant
                                        pressure
                                        may cause the bone to thicken as well, creating an even larger lump to rub
                                        against
                                        the
                                        shoe.</p>
                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>A bunion can be painful and the deformity can become a cosmetic problem to many,
                                        often
                                        making it hard to find appropriate shoe wear. Increasing deformity begins to
                                        displace
                                        the second toe upward, creating additional rubbing on the shoe.</p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>Diagnosis begins with a careful history and physical examination by your doctor.
                                        X-rays
                                        will allow your doctor to measure several important angles made by the bones of
                                        the
                                        feet
                                        to help determine the appropriate treatment.</p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Treatment of a bunion nearly always starts with adapting the shoes to fit the
                                        feet;
                                        converting from a pointed-toe shoe to a shoe with a wider toe box can arrest the
                                        progression of the deformity. Bunion pads may reduce pressure and rubbing from
                                        the
                                        shoe.
                                        These are also numerous devices, such as toe spacers, that attempt to splint the
                                        big
                                        toe
                                        and reverse the deforming forces.</p>
                                    <p>If all conservative measures fail to control the symptoms, then surgery may be
                                        suggested.
                                        There are well over 100 surgical procedures described to treat hallux valgus.
                                        The
                                        basic
                                        considerations are removing the bunion, realigning the bones that make up the
                                        big
                                        toe,
                                        and balancing the forces so the deformity does not return.</p>

                                    <p>Like any other joint in the body, the joint at the base of the great toe is
                                        covered
                                        with
                                        articular cartilage, a very slick, shiny covering on the end of the bone. If
                                        this
                                        material is injured, it begins a slow process of “wearing out” or degeneration.
                                        This
                                        can
                                        result in a wearing away of the articular surface, until raw bone rubs against
                                        raw
                                        bone.

                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>The degeneration causes two problems: pain and a loss of motion in the joint.
                                        Without

                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>Diagnosis is usually apparent on examination but x-rays are usually required to
                                        determine
                                        the extent of the degeneration and the bone spur formation.</p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Treatment begins with anti-inflammatory medication to control the inflammation of
                                        the
                                        degenerative arthritis. Special shoes that reduce the amount of bend in the toe
                                        during
                                        walking will also help the symptoms initially. A rocker-type sole allows the
                                        shoe to
                                        take some of the bending force, and may be combined with a metal brace in the
                                        sole
                                        to
                                        limit the flexibility of the sole of the shoe and reduce the motion needed in
                                        the
                                        MTP
                                        joint. Injection of cortisone into the joint may temporarily relieve symptoms.
                                        If
                                        all

                                    <p class="summary">A bunionette is similar to a bunion but on the outside edge or
                                        lateral
                                        side of the foot. It is sometimes referred to as a “tailor’s bunion” due to the
                                        fact
                                        that tailors once sat cross-legged all day with the outside of their feet
                                        rubbing on
                                        the
                                        ground. This produced a pressure area and callus at the base of the fifth toe.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                                    <p>A bunionette is most likely caused by an abnormal prominence over the fifth
                                        metatarsal
                                        head rubbing on shoes that are too narrow. As they grow older, some people have
                                        a
                                        widening of the foot until it spreads or “splays”, causing a bunion on one side
                                        of
                                        the
                                        foot and a bunionette on the other if the patient continues to wear shoes that
                                        are
                                        too
                                        narrow. The constant pressure produces a callus and a thickening of the bursa
                                        over
                                        the
                                        area, leading to a painful knob on the outside of the foot.</p>
                                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                    <p>The symptoms of a bunionette include pain and difficulty buying shoes that will
                                        accommodate the deformity. The swelling in the area causes a visible bump that
                                        some
                                        people find unsightly.</p>
                                    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                    <p>The diagnosis of a bunionette is usually obvious on physical examination. X-rays
                                        may
                                        help
                                        to determine whether the joint has arthritis or if there is an abnormal growth
                                        from
                                        the
                                        metatarsal bone.</p>
                                    <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
                                    <p>Treatment is very similar to that of a bunion deformity. Anti-inflammatory
                                        medications
                                        can be helpful in the early stages. Shoes that have a wider toe box and a lower
                                        heel
                                        often resolve the problem after a few weeks. Small pads or the generous use of
                                        lamb’s
                                        wool to pad the deformity can decrease the irritation. If all else fails, your
                                        surgeon
                                        may recommend surgery to remove the bump along the bone and tighten the
                                        soft-tissue
                                        structures to straighten the 5th toe. Although initially very successful, if you
                                        return
                                        to tight shoes the deformity frequently returns.</p>
